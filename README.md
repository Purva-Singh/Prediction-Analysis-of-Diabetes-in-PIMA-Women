Due to the rapid increase in the number of diabetic people, it is essential to rightly identify the factors that contribute to the occurrence of diabetes. In this project, we have focused solely on diabetes in Pima women. The objective is to create an interactive dashboard using R Shiny, HTML and CSS to display the analysis on the data and build a logistic regression model to predict if the patient is diabetic or not. Overall, the model gave an accuracy of 76%.
